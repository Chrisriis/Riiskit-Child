# Riiskit Child

This is Riiskit's child theme; a developer focused parent theme that's based on _Underscore_, _HTML5 Boilerplate_, _SMACSS_ and intergrates _Gulp_.

Riiskit: https://github.com/Chrisriis/riiskit

## Installation
Install Riiskit first.

Then you need to have installed both _npm_ and _gulp_. After that, you simply locate (cd) the folder with your CLI and write:

* _npm install_
* _gulp_

Then just wait some minutes for the packages to install and voila!

## Features
* Gulp workflow that intergrates browsersync, babel, compilation, compression, linting etc.
* Clean and animated CSS mobilemenu.
* Lots of useful template tags.
* Lots of useful CSS helper classes and mixins.
* SASS, OOCSS, BEM and SMACSS.
* WP Customizer settings for common usage.
* IE8+ support.
* Modern semantics and accessibility features.

## Workflow
__Watch:__ After having installed everything, you can type _gulp watch_ to make gulp compile your files everytime you make a change etc.

__BrowserSync__: Before you activate/write _gulp autorefresh_, make sure your localhost address is correct. The default is set to _127.0.0.1_. If you use another port like 8888, you must edit the gulpfile.js, at the bottom of the file where the address is located.
